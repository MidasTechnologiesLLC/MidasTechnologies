MIDAS TECHNOLOGIES: Executive Summary

Mission Statement: 

The goal of Midas Technologies is to develop algorithmic investment software over-time to build a diversified fund of algorithmic trading strategies that yield an above market return on as frequent a basis as possible. 



Business Model: 

Build an algorithmic trading Python program, that accurately predicts, and trades shares and options on the price of crude oil. This algorithm will have the goal of getting a given return with a given risk level on a weekly basis. The algorithm will not be used on the market until it has a consistent win rate of 60% and above. We will trade this based on technical indicators



Technology Overview:

The program will be built like this:

Price Prediction Models:

Speculative Indicators: These will be functions that analyze aspects of a news article or other variable to come to a conclusion of how much the price of oil will change in a dollar value. Each indicator needs to print out a predicted price for tomorrow

Economic Indicators: These will be functions that analyze relationships between different economic factors based on data such as GDP, supply, demand, and USD. Each indicator need to print out a predicted price for tomorrow

All prices will be fed into a weighted average formula. The formula will show the predicted price at market close tomorrow. The weights represent the percentage the market thinks that particular indicator is important



Market Importance Ranking

Based on optimizing of the above problem to minimize margin of error, we will find the weights. These weights will be the backbone of our predictions and we 

must test them continuously to find the most accurate price prediction.
