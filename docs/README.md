# Documentation Directory

Welcome to the **Documentation** directory for the project. This directory is divided into three primary sections: **Business Documentation**, **Policies and Standards**, and **Man Pages**. Each subdirectory has a unique purpose and serves to organize our project’s documentation comprehensively. Please follow the structure and guidelines below when adding new documents.

## Sections

### 1. Business Documentation

- **Purpose**: Contains all relevant business-related documentation, legal filings, and operational plans. This section helps ensure that we keep a clear record of our company’s structural and strategic information.
- **Contents**:
  - `business_plan.md`: Outlines our company’s mission, vision, target market, competitive analysis, and growth strategies.
  - `lcc_documentation.md`: Contains LLC formation details, ownership structure, and any legal requirements.
  - `legal_license.md`: Provides a summary of licenses, terms, and legal disclaimers for our software products.

### 2. Policies and Standards

- **Purpose**: This section includes all coding, collaboration, and workflow guidelines to maintain consistency and quality across the project. It also contains standard operating procedures (SOPs) for code quality and collaboration, fostering a productive and unified development environment.
- **Contents**:
  - `coding_standards.md`: Outlines coding conventions and best practices for this project.
  - `code_review_policy.md`: Details our policies for reviewing code and handling pull requests.
  - `documentation_standards.md`: Specifies standards for documenting code and creating README files.
  - `file_path_standards.md`: Establishes naming conventions and organization standards for files and directories.

### 3. Man Pages

- **Purpose**: Acts as an accessible, high-level guide to overall code structure, intended to assist both new and existing team members in understanding the project’s architecture. This section contains **man pages** for broader code documentation, while specific functionality and module-level details can be found in `src/` README files.
- **Contents**:
  - `overall_code_documentation.md`: Offers a high-level overview of the codebase, including descriptions of major components, workflows, and integrations within the project.

## Guidelines for Adding Documentation

1. **Check the Directory**:
   - Ensure you are adding files to the correct subdirectory according to the document’s purpose.
2. **Naming Conventions**:
   - Use clear, concise, and descriptive file names for new documents.
   - File names should be lowercase and use underscores instead of spaces (e.g., `new_policy_doc.md`).
3. **Update Section Summaries**:
   - When adding new files, briefly update this `README.md` to reflect any changes within each section.

Each contributor should refer to this directory and structure before adding or modifying documentation to maintain clarity and organization throughout the project. For specific questions on policies or code documentation, refer to the relevant files in **Policies and Standards** or **Man Pages**.
