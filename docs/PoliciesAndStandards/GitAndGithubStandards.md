## Introduction

Git and GitHub are essential tools in the modern development landscape, allowing developers to manage changes, work collaboratively, and maintain robust codebases. Git is a distributed version control system that tracks code history, while GitHub enhances this by offering a platform for hosting, reviewing, and managing projects.

This guide delves into both Git and GitHub, providing an extensive overview that covers everything from beginner concepts to advanced techniques and command usage.

---

## Understanding Version Control

**Version Control** is the backbone of any collaborative software development project. It allows teams to track code changes, collaborate seamlessly, and maintain a history of modifications to revert to previous versions when needed.

### Types of Version Control

1. **Local Version Control**: Simple, single-machine control, not suitable for team environments.
2. **Centralized Version Control (CVCS)**: Stores all file versions on a central server (e.g., SVN).
3. **Distributed Version Control (DVCS)**: Each team member has a full copy of the history and the latest version of the project, with Git being the most prominent DVCS.

Git is distributed, so it allows every developer to maintain a complete copy of the codebase on their own system, making collaboration more resilient and flexible.

---

## Git Basics

### What is Git?

Git is a **distributed version control system** (DVCS) designed to handle projects of all sizes efficiently. It tracks changes to files, enabling developers to manage, review, and revert code.

### Core Concepts of Git

1. **Repository**: A collection of files, folders, and their complete revision history.
2. **Commit**: A snapshot of changes with a unique identifier (hash).
3. **Branch**: A separate line of development within a repository.
4. **Merge**: Combines changes from one branch into another, either to incorporate new features or resolve conflicts.
5. **Pull Request (PR)**: A request to merge changes from one branch into another with a code review.

---

## Getting Started with Git

### Installing Git

To start using Git, install it on your local system:
- **Linux**: `sudo apt-get install git`
- **macOS**: `brew install git`
- **Windows**: Download from [Git’s website](https://git-scm.com/).

### Configuring Git

Set up your name and email, which will be attached to your commits:
```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

To verify configurations:
```bash
git config --list
```

---

## Git Essentials

### Repositories

A **repository** (repo) is the core structure of any Git project. It includes all project files, a history of changes, and branch information.

### Staging and Committing

1. **Staging**: The process of adding files to the staging area to prepare them for a commit.
2. **Committing**: Saves a snapshot of the staged changes in the repository with a unique identifier and message.

Basic workflow:
```bash
git add <filename>    # Stage changes
git commit -m "Add description of changes"  # Commit staged changes
```

### Branches and Merging

Branches let you create separate environments for development, allowing you to work on features without affecting the main codebase. Merging incorporates changes from one branch into another.

```bash
git branch <branch-name>       # Create a new branch
git checkout <branch-name>     # Switch to that branch
git merge <branch-name>        # Merge branch into current branch
```

---

## Introduction to GitHub

### What is GitHub?

GitHub is a cloud-based platform for Git repositories, providing tools for collaboration, code review, and project management.

### Key Features of GitHub

- **Pull Requests**: Propose and discuss changes before merging.
- **Issues**: Track bugs and feature requests.
- **GitHub Actions**: Automate workflows for CI/CD.
- **Project Boards**: Visual task management using Kanban-style boards.

---

## Working with Repositories on GitHub

1. **Creating a Repository**: Go to GitHub and create a new repository for your project.
2. **Cloning a Repository**: Copy a repository to your local machine with `git clone <repo-url>`.
3. **Syncing with Remote**: Use `git pull` to fetch and merge changes from the remote repo and `git push` to upload changes.

---

## Git and GitHub Workflow

### Forking and Cloning

**Forking** allows you to create a copy of another user’s repository, letting you make changes without affecting the original. **Cloning** copies a remote repository to your local machine.

### Pull Requests and Code Reviews

- **Opening a PR**: After pushing changes to a branch, create a PR on GitHub to propose merging them into the main branch.
- **Code Reviews**: Collaborators can provide feedback, request changes, or approve the PR.

### GitHub Issues and Project Management

GitHub offers **Issues** to track development tasks and **Project Boards** to organize these issues visually.

---

## Git Commands in Depth

### Working with Commits

- **View Commit History**: `git log` shows a detailed history of commits.
- **Viewing Differences**: `git diff` displays changes between commits or branches.
- **Amending a Commit**: Modify the last commit with `git commit --amend`.

### Branch Management

- **List Branches**: `git branch` shows all branches.
- **Delete a Branch**: `git branch -d <branch-name>` removes a local branch.
- **Rename a Branch**: `git branch -m <new-name>` renames the current branch.

### Merging Branches

Merging integrates changes from one branch to another. Use `git merge <branch-name>` to combine changes into the current branch.

### Rebasing

Rebasing applies commits from one branch onto another, maintaining a linear history:
```bash
git rebase <branch-name>
```

### Resetting and Reverting

- **Resetting**: Moves the repository to a previous state.
  ```bash
  git reset --hard <commit-hash>  # Discards all changes
  git reset --soft <commit-hash>  # Keeps changes in staging
  ```
- **Reverting**: Undoes a commit by creating a new commit.
  ```bash
  git revert <commit-hash>
  ```

### Stashing

Stashing lets you save changes temporarily without committing:
```bash
git stash          # Save changes
git stash apply    # Restore stashed changes
```

### Cherry-Picking

Cherry-picking applies a specific commit from one branch onto another:
```bash
git cherry-pick <commit-hash>
```

### Synchronizing with Remotes

- **Fetch**: `git fetch` downloads updates from the remote repository.
- **Pull**: `git pull` combines `fetch` and `merge`.
- **Push**: `git push` uploads local changes to the remote repository.

---

## Advanced Git Techniques

### Git Aliases

Aliases can simplify complex Git commands:
```bash
git config --global alias.st status
git config --global alias.cm commit
```

### Interactive Rebase

Interactive rebasing allows you to reorder, squash, or edit commits:
```bash
git rebase -i <base-commit>
```

---

## Common Mistakes and How to Avoid Them

### Forgetting to Stage Changes

If you forget to `git add` your changes, they won’t be included in your commit. Always check with `git status` before committing.

### Overwriting History with Rebase

Rebasing can rewrite history, so it’s recommended to avoid it on branches shared with others. Only rebase

 branches that haven’t been pushed or that you’re working on independently.

### Ignoring Merge Conflicts

When merging branches, conflicts may arise. Don’t skip or ignore these! Use a merge tool or manually resolve conflicts, and make sure to commit the resolved changes.

### Accidental Commits to the Wrong Branch

Switching branches without committing or stashing changes can result in accidental commits. Always check your branch with `git branch` before committing and use `git stash` to save uncommitted changes if you need to switch.

### Pushing Sensitive Information

Never commit sensitive data like passwords, API keys, or credentials. Use a `.gitignore` file to exclude sensitive files and directories:
```bash
echo "config.json" >> .gitignore
```

### Force Pushing

Using `git push --force` can overwrite others' work. Only use `--force` when absolutely necessary, and communicate with your team beforehand. I have removed `--force` capabilitys on the github

# Branching Structure and Naming Conventions

## Purpose
This document establishes standards for creating, naming, and managing branches within our repository. Following these guidelines will ensure a clean, organized codebase, making it easier for the team to manage code changes, facilitate collaboration, and maintain clarity across multiple projects.

## Table of Contents

---

## Branch Structure

Our repository follows a structured branching system with two main branches, `main` and `dev`, along with various **feature** and **ad-hoc branches** off `dev` for specific tasks. **All branches off `dev` should be named according to the conventions defined in this document.**

### 1. `main` Branch

- **Purpose**: The `main` branch contains **production-ready code**. This is where stable, tested code resides and reflects the latest release version of the codebase.
- **Access**: Only project maintainers can directly merge code into `main`.
- **Merges**: Code merges into `main` should always come from `dev` after passing code reviews and tests.
- **Protection**: This branch is protected by branch rules, requiring code reviews and successful checks before merging.

### 2. `dev` Branch

- **Purpose**: The `dev` branch is a **staging branch for testing** new features, bug fixes, and documentation updates before they reach `main`.
- **Access**: All contributors can create branches off `dev` for their work. Contributors are not allowed to push directly to `dev`; all changes must be submitted via pull requests.
- **Merges**: All feature, bugfix, documentation, and test branches should be merged back into `dev` after review and testing.

### 3. Feature and Ad-Hoc Branches

- **Purpose**: Branches off `dev` are used for specific features, bug fixes, testing updates, and documentation changes. These branches must follow the naming conventions detailed in the following section.
- **Lifecycle**: Feature and ad-hoc branches are created for individual tasks and are short-lived. Once their purpose is completed, they are merged into `dev` and deleted.
- **Permissions**: Contributors create, work on, and manage these branches off `dev` but **must submit pull requests (PRs) for all changes to `dev`**.

> **Note**: Only the GitHub repository manager may deviate from these conventions.

---

## Branch Naming Conventions

To maintain organization and readability, all branches off `dev` must follow these naming conventions. Standard prefixes indicate the branch's purpose and scope, providing clarity to other contributors.

### General Rules

- **Lowercase Only**: Branch names must be in lowercase.
- **Hyphens for Separation**: Use hyphens (`-`) to separate words within a branch name.
- **Descriptive Names**: Branch names should indicate the purpose of the branch (e.g., feature, bugfix) and include an identifier if relevant.
- **Reference to Issue/Feature Numbers**: When applicable, include a reference to the GitHub issue number.

### Prefixes

| Prefix       | Purpose                                   | Example                                   |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `feature/`   | For new features or enhancements          | `feature/user-authentication`             |
| `bugfix/`    | For fixing known bugs or issues           | `bugfix/1023-login-error`                 |
| `docs/`      | For documentation updates and additions   | `docs/api-endpoints-documentation`        |
| `test/`      | For changes or additions to tests         | `test/add-unit-tests`                     |
| `hotfix/`    | For critical fixes that need immediate attention in `dev` or `main` | `hotfix/production-fix-login-error`   |

> **Note**: All prefixes indicate branches off `dev` and should not directly branch from `main` without repository manager approval.

### Branch Names, Scenarios and Examples

| Purpose           | Branch Name                        | Description                                |
|-------------------|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| New Feature       | `feature/user-registration`        | Adds user registration functionality       |
| Bug Fix           | `bugfix/215-api-authorization`     | Fixes authorization issue on API requests  |
| Documentation     | `docs/setup-instructions`          | Adds setup instructions to documentation   |
| Testing           | `test/integration-test-api`        | Adds integration tests for API endpoints   |
| Hotfix            | `hotfix/cache-issue`              | Urgent fix for cache-related issue         |

When working on specific aspects of the project, contributors should use designated branches to ensure consistency and organization. **All branches, unless specified, must be created off the `dev` branch**. Below are common scenarios and the appropriate branches for each task:

#### 1. **Adding a Web Scraper**

   - **Branch**: `DataCollection` (branch off `dev`)
   - **Process**:
     - Begin by switching to the `dev` branch: 
       ```bash
       git checkout dev
       git pull origin dev
       ```
     - Check out the `DataCollection` branch:
       ```bash
       git checkout DataCollection
       ```
     - If `DataCollection` does not exist, create it off `dev`:
       ```bash
       git checkout -b DataCollection dev
       git push -u origin DataCollection
       ```

#### 2. **Adding Documentation**

   - **Branch**: `docs` (branch off `dev`)
   - **Process**:
     - Switch to the `dev` branch and pull the latest updates:
       ```bash
       git checkout dev
       git pull origin dev
       ```
     - Check out the `docs` branch:
       ```bash
       git checkout docs
       ```
     - If `docs` does not exist, create it off `dev`:
       ```bash
       git checkout -b docs dev
       git push -u origin docs
       ```

#### 3. **Adding Business Files**

   - **Branch**: `businessfiles` (branch off `dev`)
   - **Process**:
     - Ensure you’re working from the latest `dev` updates:
       ```bash
       git checkout dev
       git pull origin dev
       ```
     - Check out the `businessfiles` branch:
       ```bash
       git checkout businessfiles
       ```
     - If `businessfiles` does not exist, create it off `dev`:
       ```bash
       git checkout -b businessfiles dev
       git push -u origin businessfiles
       ```

#### 4. **Bug Fixes**

   - **Branch**: `bugfix` (branch off `dev`)
   - **Process**:
     - Start from the latest `dev` updates:
       ```bash
       git checkout dev
       git pull origin dev
       ```
     - Check out the `bugfix` branch:
       ```bash
       git checkout bugfix
       ```
     - If `bugfix` does not exist, create it:
       ```bash
       git checkout -b bugfix dev
       git push -u origin bugfix
       ```

#### 5. **Hotfixes**

   - **Branch**: `hotfix` (branch off `dev`)
   - **Process**:
     - Ensure your local `dev` branch is up to date:
       ```bash
       git checkout dev
       git pull origin dev
       ```
     - Check out the `hotfix` branch:
       ```bash
       git checkout hotfix
       ```
     - If `hotfix` does not exist, create it:
       ```bash
       git checkout -b hotfix dev
       git push -u origin hotfix
       ```

#### 6. **Testing**

   - **Branch**: `testing` (branch off `dev`)
   - **Process**:
     - Start from the latest `dev` branch:
       ```bash
       git checkout dev
       git pull origin dev
       ```
     - Check out the `testing` branch:
       ```bash
       git checkout testing
       ```
     - If `testing` does not exist, create it:
       ```bash
       git checkout -b testing dev
       git push -u origin testing
       ```

#### 7. **Feature Development**

   - **Branch**: `feature/feature-name` (branch off `dev`)
   - **Process**:
     - Before starting, always check if a specific feature branch exists.
     - If no specific branch exists, create a new feature branch off `dev`:
       ```bash
       git checkout dev
       git pull origin dev
       git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name dev
       git push -u origin feature/your-feature-name
       ```
     - **Note**: Follow the naming conventions for all feature branches and verify it branches off `dev`.

## Handling Merge Conflicts

Merge conflicts can occur when changes in two branches affect the same lines of code. Here are best practices and commands to resolve them effectively.

### Steps to Resolve Merge Conflicts

1. **Identify the Conflict**:
   - When attempting to merge, Git will notify you of conflicts. Use the `git status` command to identify files with conflicts:
     ```bash
     git status
     ```

2. **Open and Review Conflicting Files**:
   - Open the conflicting files in an editor. Git marks conflicts with `<<<<<<<`, `=======`, and `>>>>>>>`.
   - Manually review the changes, decide which version to keep, or combine changes where necessary.

3. **Mark Conflicts as Resolved**:
   - After resolving conflicts in each file, mark it as resolved:
     ```bash
     git add <file-name>
     ```

4. **Complete the Merge**:
   - Once all conflicts are resolved, commit the merge:
     ```bash
     git commit
     ```

5. **Push the Resolved Branch**:
   - After committing, push the branch to the remote repository:
     ```bash
     git push
     ```

### Best Practices for Conflict Resolution

- **Resolve Locally**: If possible, resolve conflicts on your local machine to minimize errors and ensure all changes are reviewed.
- **Communicate with Team Members**: If the conflict is complex or affects significant code, communicate with the involved team members for clarity and to avoid overwriting important changes.
- **Use Git Tools for Assistance**: Tools like `git diff` and `git log` are helpful for understanding changes in context. Additionally, many IDEs offer merge tools that visualize conflicts.

---

## File Naming Standards

To maintain a consistent and organized structure, file names should follow these standards based on file type.

### Documentation Files

- **Capitalized Case**: Use Capitalized Case for documentation files (e.g., `GitAndGitHubStandards.md`).
- **Avoid Special Characters**: Do not use spaces or special characters.
- **Location**: Documentation related to each project should be stored within a `docs/` or `documentation/` directory in the root of each project.

### Code Files

- **Lowercase with Underscores**: Use lowercase names with underscores (e.g., `user_authentication.py`).
- **No Spaces or Special Characters**: Avoid spaces or special characters in code file names.
- **Descriptive Names**: Name files according to their primary function or feature (e.g., `data_processing.py` for data processing functions).

### Directory Naming

- **Organization by Function**: Directories should be organized by functionality (e.g., `models/`, `controllers/`, `tests/`).
- **Standard Directory Names**: Keep directory names simple and standardized to make navigation intuitive.

> **Example Directory Structure**:
```
project_root/
│
├── docs/
│   └── README.md
├── src/
│   ├── models/
│   ├── controllers/
│   ├── utils/
│   └── main.py
└── tests/
    ├── test_data_processing.py
    └── test_user_authentication.py
```

---

## Workflow for Contributors

This workflow ensures consistent practices across contributors for setting up branches, working locally, and pushing changes.

### Step 0: Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local environment if you haven’t already.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:MiadTechnologiesLCC/MidasTechnologies.git
cd MidasTechnologies
```

### Step 1: Set Up Branch Tracking

Ensure you have the latest branches set up locally:

```bash
git fetch origin
```

### Step 2: Check Out `dev` for New Work

Always base new work off the `dev` branch:

```bash
git checkout dev
git pull origin dev  # Ensure dev is up to date
```

### Step 3: Create a New Branch Off `dev`

Create a new branch for your work based on the type of work you’re doing (feature, bugfix, docs, etc.). Follow the branch naming conventions.

```bash
git checkout -b feature/new-feature-name dev
```

### Step 4: Make and Commit Changes

As you work, make regular commits with clear, descriptive messages following our commit message standards:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add feature description"
```

### Step 5: Push the Branch to GitHub

When ready, push your branch to GitHub:

```bash
git push -u origin feature/new-feature-name
```

### Step 6: Create a Pull Request

- **Create PR**: Go to GitHub and create a pull request (PR) from your feature branch into `dev`.
- **Review Request**: Assign reviewers as necessary and respond to feedback.
- **Ensure Compliance**: Confirm that the PR adheres to all required tests, checks, and naming conventions before approval and merging.

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Directly Branching Off `main`**: All branches should be created off `dev` unless given explicit permission from the repository manager.
2. **Inconsistent Naming**: Stick to prefix conventions and lowercase names with hyphens to maintain clarity.
3. **Forgetting to Pull `dev` Updates**: Always pull the latest changes from `dev` to avoid conflicts.
4. **Pushing to `dev` Without a PR**: Changes should never be pushed directly to `dev`; submit all changes via a pull request.
5. **Improper File Naming**: Follow naming standards strictly, with documentation files in Capitalized Case and code files in lowercase with underscores.

## Code Review Workflow

### Opening a Pull Request

When creating a Pull Request (PR), adhere to the following guidelines to ensure a smooth and productive review process:

1. **Branch Source**:
   - PRs must originate from designated branches, such as **feature**, **bugfix**, **hotfix**, or **docs**, following the [Branch Naming Conventions](./Branch%20Naming%20Conventions.md).
   - PRs should generally target the `dev` branch, while only production-ready PRs may target the `main` branch. Merges to `main` are restricted to project maintainers to maintain code quality.

2. **Title & Description**:
   - Use a clear and concise title for each PR.
   - Provide a thorough description, covering context, scope, and any relevant issues or implementation details.
   - Clearly indicate any special requirements for deployment, breaking changes, or additional dependencies.

3. **File Organization**:
   - Follow the [# file-path standards](#file-path-standards) to ensure all new files and directories are structured for efficient navigation and ease of maintenance.

### Review Assignment and Timeline

- Assign PRs to experienced reviewers in relevant code areas. For complex changes, multiple reviewers may be required.
- Use GitHub tags to notify reviewers, aiming for a 24–48 hour turnaround on PR reviews to support an efficient workflow.

---

## Working with Pull Requests

### Create a PR for Each Feature

- Link the PR to any associated issues or tasks for traceability.
- Request a review from team members knowledgeable about the relevant functionality.

### Resolve All Conversations Before Merging

- Address all reviewer feedback and mark conversations as resolved before final approval.
- If substantial modifications are made in response to feedback, re-request a review to ensure consensus.

### Merge Protocol

- **PRs into `dev`**: These require at least one reviewer’s approval.
- **PRs from `dev` to `main`**: Limited to the project maintainer, with thorough testing and final approval required to ensure the stability of `main`.

---

## Code Review Focus Areas

Reviewers should concentrate on these critical areas to ensure quality, functionality, and maintainability across the codebase:

### Code Quality and Consistency

- Follow our [Coding Standards](./Coding%20Standards.md) for readability, maintainability, and consistency.
- Maintain modularity and avoid redundancy, using existing functions or libraries where appropriate.
- Confirm adherence to language-specific standards (e.g., PEP8 for Python).

### Functionality and Completeness

- Verify that the code performs as intended without regressions.
- Ensure all specified use cases, including edge cases, are covered. Seek clarification from the contributor if requirements are ambiguous.

### Testing and Coverage

- Check for sufficient test coverage, ideally at least 85%, with a preference for automated tests.
- Ensure all tests, including unit, integration, and end-to-end (E2E) tests, pass successfully.
- Confirm compliance with the [# file-path standards](#file-path-standards) for consistency in test file organization.

### Security and Performance

- Assess for potential security vulnerabilities, especially in areas related to data handling, user authentication, or API calls.
- Evaluate performance, suggesting improvements if any bottlenecks or inefficiencies are detected.

### Documentation and Commenting

- All public functions, classes, and methods should have clear docstrings, following our [Documentation Standards](./Documentation%20Standards.md).
- Complex logic should be well-commented to explain non-standard approaches or optimizations.
- Verify updates to user or developer documentation when relevant.

### File Structure and Organization

- Ensure new files and directories align with the [# file-path standards](#file-path-standards) to maintain logical structure.
- Check that file organization is consistent with the established hierarchy, supporting ease of access and maintenance.

## Final Approval and Merging Process

### Approval Requirements

- PRs must have at least one reviewer’s approval, with additional reviewers for complex or high-risk changes.
- Only project maintainers or designated personnel may approve and merge PRs into `main`.

### Merging to Dev or Main

- **Merging into `dev`**: Contributors may merge PRs after at least one review and approval.
- **Merging into `main`**: Restricted to maintainers; requires extensive testing to confirm production readiness.

### Final Checks Before Merging

- Ensure all tests pass and the latest code changes are integrated into the PR.
- Verify the [# file-path standards](#file-path-standards) are followed and the directory structure is organized.
- Update the PR description with any final notes or additional context.

## Common Code Review Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Skipping Self-Review**: Self-review reduces back-and-forth and helps identify issues preemptively.
2. **Insufficient Test Coverage**: Lack of comprehensive tests can lead to unexpected bugs. Aim to cover all use cases and edge scenarios.
3. **Premature Approval**: Ensure understanding of the PR’s purpose and functionality before approving.
4. **File and Path Non-Compliance**: Files should adhere to naming and path standards as detailed in [# file-path standards](#file-path-standards).

## Post-Review Responsibilities

### Continuous Improvement

- Identify opportunities for process improvement based on challenges encountered during the review.
- Record valuable lessons, significant changes, or patterns in a shared knowledge base for future use.

### Follow-up Tasks

- Log any remaining issues or future improvements as GitHub issues for future sprints.
- Update documentation when significant changes impact user guides, API references, or other project docs.

### Retrospective and Feedback

- Periodically evaluate the review process's effectiveness, gathering feedback to refine workflow, collaboration, and code quality practices.
