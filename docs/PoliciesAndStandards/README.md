## Overview

This directory serves as the central reference point for all policies and standards governing our project’s development practices. Each document is purpose-built to address specific facets of our workflow, from coding conventions to GitHub management. Contributors should familiarize themselves with each section to ensure their work aligns with our established standards.

## File Descriptions

### 1. CodingStandards.md
**Purpose**: Defines the coding standards for our primary language, Python, along with additional guidelines for languages that interact with Python (e.g., C, JSON, Rust).

**Key Points**:
   - **Python Coding Standards**: Emphasizes PEP8 adherence, docstrings, naming conventions, and version control with `venv`.
   - **Interface Language Standards**: Guidance on C extensions, Rust integration, TypeScript, JSON, and SQL standards.
   - **Virtual Environments**: Explanation of `venv` management, `.gitignore` configurations, and best practices for `requirements.txt`.

**Useful for**: Any team member involved in writing or reviewing code across languages, especially those needing to understand Python-centric practices.

### 2. CommunicationStandards.md
**Purpose**: Provides guidelines for communication, task assignment, and collaboration methods, ensuring smooth project coordination and prompt issue resolution.

**Key Points**:
   - **Communication Channels**: Standards for using GitHub Issues, Pull Requests, and team meetings.
   - **Collaborative Practices**: Code review protocols, issue assignments, and conflict resolution strategies.
   - **Labor Distribution**: Suggested systems for assigning and managing tasks effectively within GitHub.

**Useful for**: Contributors and project managers coordinating workflow, code reviews, and project task assignments.

### 3. DocumentationStandards.md
**Purpose**: Outlines best practices for documenting code, project functionality, and business-related information, maintaining accessible and comprehensive documentation.

**Key Points**:
   - **README and Inline Documentation**: Standards for writing and organizing README files for each module, docstrings, and inline comments.
   - **Documentation File Naming**: Instructions on file naming, Markdown use, and placement of documentation within the directory structure.
   - **Documentation for Modular Code**: Guidelines on modular documentation, where root-level modules should contain individual `README.md` files.

**Useful for**: Anyone writing documentation, comments, or README files to support the codebase and clarify business practices.

### 4. FilePathStandards.md
**Purpose**: Establishes naming conventions and directory structures to ensure consistency across the entire codebase.

**Key Points**:
   - **Directory Structure**: Suggested layout for primary directories (`src/`, `docs/`, `tests/`, etc.) and subdirectories for functionality-specific code.
   - **File Naming Conventions**: Rules for lowercase, underscored, and hyphenated naming styles to avoid ambiguity.
   - **Special Conventions**: Specific guidelines for the `docs/` directory structure, README file formats, and `data` directory usage.

**Useful for**: Contributors adding or reorganizing files, ensuring all files and directories comply with standard naming and structure guidelines.

### 5. GitAndGitHubStandards.md
**Purpose**: Provides a thorough explanation of Git and GitHub practices, branch naming conventions, and commit message formatting, ensuring effective version control and collaboration.

**Key Points**:
   - **Git Overview and Workflows**: Explains the basics of Git, including branch structure, merging practices, and handling merge conflicts.
   - **Commit Messages**: Detailed formatting for clear and useful commit messages.
   - **Branch Naming Conventions**: Guidelines on naming branches based on purpose (e.g., `feature/`, `bugfix/`) to keep the repository organized.

**Useful for**: Contributors managing version control through Git and GitHub, particularly when creating branches or preparing for merges.
